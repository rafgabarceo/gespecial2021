Atheena Lastimosa, I, BS-APC (RVRCOB)
“Being a leader is not just all about the fame and titles that come with it. No amount of recognition will replace the passion or flaming heart of a true leader. I want to see a leader that is dedicated, passion-driven, and empathetic. They must be someone that will embody the achievements, struggles, and beliefs of the student body, someone that will be the rightful voice of every Lasallian. It is also essential that this leader has the confidence and strength to really fight for what is right and just.”
Sophie Rendon, I, BS-APC (RVRCOB)
“A leader that has a vision for the future of the country and possesses effective leadership aimed at sustainable development. One that works to achieve the sustainable development goals by focusing on long-term goals without compromising resources, ethics, and principles. Moreover, a leader that acknowledges the truth and has the courage to humble oneself to actively listen to diverse perspectives and gain a better viewpoint of the actions one must take. There is a wealth of knowledge in the world, and a wise leader should always be exploring and learning with the passion to uplift their nation. I want a leader that cares enough about the state of humanity and the entire biodiversity at large for the realities of today as well as the unknown possibilities of tomorrow.”
Maria Angelica Pechon, I, BS-APC (RVRCOB)
“Perhaps the greatest quality a leader must possess is the one that has the capacity to motivate and make a positive change in everyone’s life. He/She/They focus on the bigger picture of where the consensus is headed and committed to having a vision for the people. Good leadership for me is more than just leading and setting goals, leadership is going beyond and paving the way for people to show sincere interest in participating and relating to the thoughts and experiences that we wish to improve as a community.  This will serve as a stepping stone in achieving progressive service and form positive connections for everyone.”
Jana Unise Nuez, II, BS-IBS (RVRCOB)
“In this upcoming 2022 elections, I look forward to the leaders of USG to promote and advocate to everyone in De La Salle University and outside that each of us must, and have the right to vote for leaders who we know and believe would finally seek solutions to alleviate the main issues our country is dealing with. I also foresee that the leaders of USG are those who are passionate about their fellow lasallians exercising their rights to vote, thus, would continue to encourage all, or if not most, to register and vote responsibly.”
Loise Ambat, III, BS-MKT (RVRCOB)
“I don’t really have a particular political advocacy or agenda in mind as of the moment, but I would like to see our USG support something that would prioritize the betterment of the students especially with the ongoing pandemic. For instance, we all know that online learning has been a struggle for many of us. I would like to see how our student leaders would fight for a more accessible learning system for all.”
Rocio Tabamo, III, AB-SEA (CLA)
“The kind of leader I want to see in the 2022 elections is someone who can lead by example. By this, I mean that he or she can give due credit to his or her subordinates and at the same time inspire and help them be great leaders in the future as well. Someone strong-willed, courageous, persistent, hard working, and has "malasakit" to people around is what I think, too, deserves to be a leader. Overall however, in the upcoming elections, I wish to see not only leaders and aspiring leaders with these qualities but also informed, responsible, and prudent voters.”
Erika Arcega, III, AB-SEA (CLA)
“The kind of leader I would want our USG to rally behind in the 2022 elections would be someone who is a visionary. I would want a leader who can acknowledge the intersectionality of the issues that plague our society and resolve them by putting in the work to pave the way for the future for our country; their personal interest should be for the benefit of the peoples of the Philippines, regardless of ethnicity and social status. Furthermore, they should be the embodiment of the ideal Filipino - sa isip, sa salita, at sa gawa.”
Frances De Leon, III, AB-ISA (CLA)
“The kind of leader I would want our USG to rally behind in the 2022 elections would be someone who will genuinely and wholeheartedly serve the people. Someone who will not prioritize his/her personal interests and will push for policies that will help our nation and our people flourish. Someone who will lead by example and is not all talk and no action. Lastly, someone who will fight for the rights of the people especially those who are neglected in our society.”
Patrick Borje, III, AB-ISA (CLA)
“I would like for my USG to rally behind a leader who promotes Good Governance and Accountability, and most importantly, Care and Compassion for the Filipino people.”
Nina Yu, III, AB-ISE (CLA)
“A leader should be someone who is transparent with their fellow citizens, consistent with their decision making, and listens to what us people want, and someone who’s willing to take accountability especially when they’re being criticized. That’s the kind of leader I want the USG to support.”
Gio Ver, III, AB-PSM (CLA)
“Living in a world full of uncertainties, I want to see our USG rally behind a leader who has concrete plans in mind and is someone who has evidently helped our countrymen and women who are in need. I would also want our USG to rally behind a leader who is willing to listen to the public and is willing to adapt to the ongoing situation.”
Gabriel Tenorio, II, AB-PSM (CLA)
“As the 2022 Elections are coming near, the one who will lead must be capable of assessing the distinct opinions given by the Lasallian community. From there, the leader could give them the suitable and appropriate direction on how we should properly exercise our vote in the upcoming 2022 elections. To add, the leader may somehow give light to the Lasallian community since we are all currently in a pandemic state, and this notion could motivate us to vote for the betterment of our country.”
Girbaud Mangahis, II, AB-CAM (CLA)
“The type of leader I aspire to see is the one that provides a shared purpose with the people. A humble leader that exemplifies that the power is not with the leader but is within its people.”
Orrel Poul Bandilla, II, AB-ISA (CLA)
“I want a leader who truly understands the needs of the people—going beyond the surface level. A leader who reaches out to various socio-economic sectors of Philippine society, ensuring that every Filipino becomes integral to the development process and isn’t left behind. Our country needs someone who is compassionate and progressive, an individual the Filipino people could rally behind and support because he or she is a role model to everyone—especially the youth of today.” 
Jancheska Malapascua, II, BS MTH-BAP (COS)
“There are three qualities that I expect from our leaders, a leader that can speak, educate and encourage. Being a student leader should not only speak for those who need their voices to be heard, but also to educate the audience about the social issues that are relevant in the upcoming elections. They also should be able to encourage the youth to engage in activities concerning the elections so that voters will be able to choose the rightful leaders that will lead our nation. As a representative of the Lasallian community, it is our duty to serve our institution and also our country.”
Mhico Asuncion, II, BS-STAT (COS)
“Leaders should always uphold the value of honesty, humility and ability to have a strategic mindset in terms of solving the complications of his/her constituents. Good leaders should also know how to listen to their people with great attention, willingness and sincerity. Nowadays, our country needs someone who is capable of making decisions by considering the complaints and perspectives of the Filipino people. Future leaders should always keep in mind that leadership is not a power to control and manipulate the people, but it is a power that should be used in propelling our country towards betterment. And this in fact is the leader that should be rally behind not just by the USG but also the Filipino people.”
Alissander Gillean Biñas, II, BS-ChE (GCOE)
“Corruption is like an old song to the Filipino people; exploited for their personal gain, we turned a blind eye to those we idolized as so-called leaders . After all it is the Filipinos who continue to exploit our nation, but it is also the Filipinos who suffer and will find purpose in these trying times. In light of these, our next leader should have the courage and strength to fix the entirety of the broken system that plagued our beloved for decades and has genuine concern for the upliftment of the deprived, depressed, and underprivileged. Filipinos. A leader who  does not earn the right to lead through blood or fear but one who earned it through merits and goodwill. The times are changing and so should we. The Filipinos have seen and documented the plight of everyone especially the least and the lost ,we also have seen the slanderous acts of corruption of those on top and I say that I had enough. So whoever you are, we need you now to bring forth hope and glory shared by all.”
Colleen Chiu, IV, AEF-BSA (SOE)
“The USG does not only serve as a bridge between the administration and the student body, but it also defines the kind of environment Lasallians will grow in; thus, the goals and actions of our student leaders should not be taken lightly. The USG should not only take responsibility of the present but also the future of Lasallians. This entails making sure that students have a smooth enrollment process, an effective and positive classroom experience, and have access to the best out-of-class opportunities to develop their knowledge, skills, and abilities that will hone the students into becoming future leaders themselves.”
Trisha Ong, IV, AEI-ADV (SOE)
“Now more than ever, I believe the Philippines needs kind and compassionate leaders. Rather than seeking authority and power, I hope that the leaders that we elect lead by showcasing their influence through inspiring Filipinos with encouragement and empowerment. I’d love it if my fellow students can support individuals who understand the importance of listening and understanding their constituents. In this sense, empathy is not merely a preferred quality, it becomes a prerequisite to effective leadership, which is imperative to the success of the nation.”
